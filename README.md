# Census data interactive scatter 
D3 project for Monash Data Analytics Boot Camp

The purpose of this project was to build an interactive scatter plot that dynamically displays the U.S. Census data.

# Data

There is one key source of data used:

* [data.csv](D3_data_journalism/assets/data/data.csv) - .csv dataset based on U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 2014 ACS 1-year estimates: [https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml)


# Analysis

* Create a scatter plot with D3 which does the following:

  * Represents each state with circle elements

  * Includes state abbreviations in the circles

  * Adds tooltips to the circles and displays each tooltip with the data that the user has selected

  * Has all available axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart

  * Axes have click events so that user can decide which data to display

  * Is responsive uppon window size changes
